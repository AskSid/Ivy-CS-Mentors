            <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <p>
              Work in the software industry is as much about collaboration and coordination as problem solving and creativity. Understanding how to code with others and using collaborative technologies is essential to doing meaningful technology work. Our new Innovation Lab program is all about getting students with limited prior experience to be able to build real products by teaching both how to code and how to navigate the collaborative technologies programmers use every day. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Students who reach the best outcomes in computer science principally tend to be those who have received the most prior exposure to actual product development; students at top schools tend to have prior CS experience, and those that excel often have already built products. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In our Innovation Lab,  groups of 5 students will receive a comprehensive week of instruction on college level programming skills and technologies before spending a week working together to build a website, application, or large scale program that will serve as a substantial edition to a resume or portfolio. Students will walk away from the camp with genuine programming competency in an area of software engineering and a real and valuable product to show for it.

            <h2>Curriculum</h2>
            <p>
              We currently offer labs in front-end development and object oriented programming. Our front-end course will teach students HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be able to build interactive websites. Students will walk away having built a web application that demonstrates language proficiency and an understanding of both visual and responsive web design. Our object-oriented lab teaches students how to implement data structures, classes, and objects, culminating in the development of a scalable application that follows object-oriented design in the second week.             </p>

            <p>
              Our programs are ultimately about getting students to be actively engaged in learning and collaborating to build a functional software product. The best way of achieving this is through small group learning with friends. Students can join individually, but to encourage the development of a close cohort to help the collaboration, we offer a $100 discount for assembled groups of 5. Fundamentally, we want our students to be feel comfortable when they’re learning and working together and to have an experience which is both fun and fulfilling.

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>We are a group of computer science students who want to provide a high-level education to younger students. We believe that getting started with coding early leads to long-term success as kids are able to explore their interests earlier and develop key skills for the future. Our goal is to foster a curiosity to code in younger students through our classes and tutoring sessions.  </p>
